# MVF-TT

## Introduction
For this tech test I have built a Sinatra app in Ruby. This tech test completes all User Stories in Epic 1 as well as User story 3.1.

## Quick Start
Assuming your system is already set up with Ruby and Bundle, firt clone this repository then run:

```
bundle install
```
to install project dependancies and:
```
rspec
```
to run the tests. 

To run the project itself run: 
```
rackup app/app.rb
``` 
And visit localhost:9292 to view the project.

All of the endpoints in the app can be reached by entering correct information into the forms on each page.
